Vim-tabs: A Vim Plugin for Writing Guitar Tablature
==================================================

Vim-tabs is a plugin for Vim that makes writing guitar tablature easier. 

Installation
------------
You can install vim-tabs using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) by adding `Plug 'kanderoo/vim-tabs'` to your vimrc and running `:PlugInstall`. Installation using Pathogen or Vundle might be possible, but I don't use those so I'm not sure.

How to Write Tab
---------------------
Tablature in plain text isn't completely standardized, but some norms are present. If you're looking at how to write tab I highly suggest reading through both the [wikipedia page on ASCII tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_tab) and the [Guide To Tab Notation](https://www.classtab.org/tabbing.htm) by Howard Wright. The latter especially is a very good resource for a variety of tab styles.
