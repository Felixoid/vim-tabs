How to Write Tab
---------------------
Tablature in plain text isn't completely standardized, but some norms are present. If you're looking at how to write tab I highly suggest reading through both the [wikipedia page on ASCII tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_tab) and the [Guide To Tab Notation](https://www.classtab.org/tabbing.htm) by Howard Wright. The latter especially is a very good resource for a variety of tab styles.
